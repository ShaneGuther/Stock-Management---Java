# Stock Management System using Java
Created with JavaFX and JavaFXML
A school group project to develop an information storage program to store/read data from a csv file.
We chose to center our program around agricultural stock such as plants and crops, although it can easily be converted to another topic.
Main things that we focused on were using multiple data types, validating data and creating a user friendly interface.
